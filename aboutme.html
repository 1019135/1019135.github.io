        <h4>A Small Blur About Me</h4>
        <br />
    <p>Ever since I was young, I always had a knack for technology and math. It was something I looked forward to in school. I like to expand my knowledge on technology and learning new things about it.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I want to work in the Tech/Data Science Field and start a company, so I can do big things and go places. Currently, tech is changing the world and more computer science schools are opening, jobs are becoming more competitive and because of that, I want to stand out from everybody else and show that I have a talent.</p>      
    <br />
    <p>Aside from programming, I like playing music, more specifically on my cello, reading comic books, playing sports and exercising. I believe having a diverse set of interests can form a sharp mind and make you more mentally flexible.</p>
