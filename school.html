    <h1>Middle School</h1>
    <p>The middle School that I went to was MS180: The Dr. Daniel Williams School. During this time, I took up much more intrests and started coding. I praticipated in galas,concerts while I was playing cello and I learned more about coding from website such as code.org. I particpated in my Kaplan Program that tutored students who wanted to take the SHSAT, a test that qualifies them for a placement in the NY specialized highschools. I didn't get into one. But it did get into my first choice school and that's where I wanted to pursue Computer Science more.</p>
